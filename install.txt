Overview:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I been giving instructions on how to do honey-pots, I've pointed out that eye 
testing customers is a bad idea.  Than it don on me that no one has giving you
a mod that does it for you.  

This is a redesign of the should_be_empty line and added another hidden field.

Also included is a human non-CAPTCHA slider that does not test one eyes.. 

The bots..
input field have a 1 to 1 chance of completing right.
radio field has a 1 to 3 chance of completing right.
both above can be hidden or in the open depending on the answer you are looking for.

slider field has a 1 to 50 or 1000 chance of completing right.
The slider, HTML5 has a min and max and out of this extreme possibilities exist... 
lets see the bot guess that one!  You pick the number, the bot has to guess what's right.
The human slides until a world pops up that you decided was right.
The world was nothing to do but the number that would lives on does.
The slider is Mobile, desktop, and keyboard friendly.

Updated for ZC1.5.6x

Drag and drop only for zc156x version and use a compare program for zc155. 

If you want the best, use the 156x with php 7.3 and up!

Now:
1) auto name changer which well change the field name every 10 days as is set now.
2) New function to test for URL's in fields with a side effect of resetting sessions.
3) no longer need to edit header file as long as one of the 4 notifiers exist. modified by @DrByte
