# zenNonCAPTCHA
For Zen Cart 1.5.6x

CAPTCHA are such designed to prevent bots from reading them, that I have a hard time too.

When I can, I bypass sites that use CAPTCHA. Not just that I can't read them most of the time, but that the code for defeating bots is so easy and widely used! I feel that if they have to use CAPTCHA, then the rest of there code may just be as old.

The concept behind this code can be found on my blog.  What I decided to do was make it easy for ZenCart owners to do it.

The slider is precoded on the contact us, create account and write review pages.  It can be used on other pages just as easy.

Added More forms and updated code... added auto field name changer.. added an auto name changer...  added even more spam detection

increased regex string to include many other url formats.
